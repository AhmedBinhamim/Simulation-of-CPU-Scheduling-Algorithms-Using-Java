# Simulation-of-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-Using-Java
Program to simulate CPU scheduling algorithms.

In a system, there are a number of processes that are present in different states at a 
particular time. 

Some processes may be in the waiting state, others may be in the 
running state and so on. Have you ever thought how CPU selects one process out of 
some many processes for execution? 

Yes, you got it right. CPU uses some kind of 
process scheduling algorithms to select one process for its execution amongst so 
many processes. 

The process scheduling algorithms are used to maximize CPU 
utilization by increasing throughput. Our team have selected three types of process 
scheduler to come up with a simulator. These types are Non-Preemptive SJF, Preemptive SJF, and Round Robin.
